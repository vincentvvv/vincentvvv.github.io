                    <p>In my first term of University, my professor has suggested that we should attend this Hackathon. I did not know what a Hackathon was at the time, and so I attended. The atmosphere was very different compared to a classroom. Everyone is very friendly, and they all have a similar goal, which was to win. The focus of this event was to build a product with the city of Kitchener's open city data. I have joined a team, with the goal of gamifying the data to generate real time analytics that could be used by city planners to better allocate the city's resources. As I was fairly new to programming, I mainly focused on learning, creating waterframes, and also designing the product. The product we created was "Citivate", where data is generated when users use city resources. The data is then used to create real-time analytics. It was a great learning experience and I feel that I have learned a lot. In the end, we did not win 1st,2nd, or 3rd place. However, we did win a prize for being the team that had created a product that has the best use of the open city data!

                    <p>After being exposed to Unity3D in the Global Game Jam 2015, I wanted to explore game development. I really enjoy playing 2D platformer games, and I especially love pixel art. A popular MMORPG that I used to play in the past was Maplestory. I wanted to replicate the game as much as possible with the Unity physics engine. Although, some aspects of the game does not feel the same as the original. I feel that it is still an enjoyable replica of the original. This project has taught me the basics of OOP, and also the Unity Engine.

                    <p> As I am a huge fan of Chamber Crawlers, me and my partner, Shadwell, chose to work on the Chamber Crawler game. Although we were faced with many different challenges, specificaly scheduling, memmory errors, and also different coding styles, we were able to overcome them and complete the project. All in all, this project has taught me many key computer science concepts. Specifically polymorphism, classes, objects, and also team work. </p>

                    <p>During my first co-op term at Oracle Eloqua, I had to take a 1 hour commute everyday. To kill my boredom, I tend to play games on my phone. The game Two Dots, on the play store, was a very enjoyable puzzle game. I really liked the logic behind the game, and I wanted to try to replicate. Hence, the start of this project. I have developed the game in Unity3D and I have added touch features to be playable on my android device. To create this game I have used linked-lists to store the selected dots, and also the line renderer in Unity to dynamically connect the dots.</p>
