          <h5><a href="https://www.yext.com/">Yext</a> is a b2b knowledge management platform. I was a part of team "Falcon" which manages the forms for information storage.</h5>
          <h5>Before coming to Yext, I had no real experience with web development, more specifically full stack development. It took me a while to ramp up and get familiar with the code base. At the time that I have started at Yext, the company was shifting its plans. Yext wanted to bring in the digital future where AI would be able to crawl through knowledge graphs to provide consumers with the correct knowledge. In order to incorporate all the different possibilities from restaurants, to health care professionals and etc, a new project was started. This is awesome because this would mean a new fresh code base as opposed to building upon the old one.</h5>
          <h5>At Yext, I worked on full stack development with Play Framework, Google closure templates, and javascript. I hve built some new features for the upcoming Winter 2018 release. This work was demoed live for <a href="https://onward.yext.com/">Onward 2017</a>. Moreover, I also learned a lot about testing, specifically through writing unit tests and selenium testing. In addition, I have also set up different telemetry metrics to display application metrics on Grafana. Aside from my main tasks, I was also in charge of fixing tech ops.</h5>
          <h5>I really liked how my team was very flexible with the work. I was able to choose what I wanted to work on, and I was also able to choose work that I was not familiar with.</h5>
          <h5>Aside from work, the culture at Yext was awesome! We had a lunch and dinner allowance everyday, delicious snacks, and lots of drinks in the fridge. Moreover, every other Friday we would have team Retros where we would reflect upon what went well during the sprint, and what went bad. Every Thursdays we would have Manifesto where every office chimes in through a video conference to share the success of the company. In addition, when the company makes a huge sale to a restaurant, they would order a lot of food from the restaurant for us. We also went on several intern events including a speakeasy tour, team dinner, and we also go to watch Wicked on Broadway! Lastly, we also went on a team offsite to Mohonk Mountain House!</h5>
